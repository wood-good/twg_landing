# Sustainability Page Concept
## TWG - The Complete Circle of Responsibility

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 7, 2025

## Core Narrative

### The Philosophy

**"We don't just take from the forest. We are part of it."**

Every tree we harvest represents a promise—a promise to the forest, to our children, and to your children. We complete the entire cycle: from selecting the tree, through crafting your products, to planting new growth. This isn't corporate sustainability. This is personal responsibility passed down through generations who have walked these same forest paths for decades.

## Section 1: The Living Cycle

### Visual Concept: Circular Journey

```

**Interactive Element:** Click/tap each stage to reveal story

### Stage Stories:

#### 1. The Forest - "Where Everything Begins"
**Visual:** Drone footage of morning mist over forest canopy
**Content:**
"These aren't just trees to us. Three generations of our family have walked these paths, watched these forests grow, learned their rhythms. We know which slopes produce the strongest grain, which groves regenerate fastest, where the oldest giants stand guard."

**Data Point:** "47 years - Average age of trees we harvest"

#### 2. Selection - "Choosing with Purpose"
**Visual:** Forester marking a tree, examining growth rings
**Content:**
"We don't clear-cut. We select. Each tree chosen for harvest is evaluated for its impact on the surrounding forest. We take the mature, leaving the young to flourish. We thin where needed, creating space for new growth."

**Data Point:** "1 in 12 - Trees selected for harvest"

#### 3. Harvesting - "Respectful Collection"
**Visual:** Careful felling, protecting surrounding vegetation
**Content:**
"Every cut is planned to protect neighboring trees. Every path through the forest is chosen to minimize impact. What others call waste—branches, bark, sawdust—we return to the forest floor as nutrients."

**Data Point:** "100% - Forest material utilized or returned"

#### 4. Crafting - "Honoring the Material"
**Visual:** Transition from log to finished product
**Content:**
"In our workshop, we honor what the forest has given. Every board is used thoughtfully. Every offcut finds purpose. Even our sawdust becomes mulch for new plantings."

**Link:** → "See our manufacturing process"

#### 5. Planting - "Keeping the Promise"
**Visual:** Hands planting sapling, multiple generations working together
**Content:**
"For every tree harvested, we plant three. Not because regulations require it—because our grandchildren will need forests too. We plant native species, in natural patterns, creating forests, not plantations."

**Data Point:** "3:1 - Our planting ratio"

#### 6. New Growth - "The Future Taking Root"
**Visual:** Time-lapse of sapling growing, seasons changing
**Content:**
"We monitor our plantings for five years, ensuring strong establishment. The forests we plant today will be harvested by our great-grandchildren. That's the timeline we think in."

**Data Point:** "89% - Sapling survival rate after 5 years"

127,483
Trees planted since 1952
+3,847 this year

[Card 2: Forest]
47 Hectares
Under our stewardship
+2 hectares this year

[Card 3: Carbon]
-2,847 tons
Net carbon negative
Absorbing more than we use

[Card 4: Generations]

Generations committed
5th generation in training
```

### Deeper Metrics Section

**"The Numbers Tell a Story"**

**Visual:** Clean data visualization with gentle animations

| What We Track | Why It Matters | Current Status |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Biodiversity Index** | Healthy forests need variety | 14 native species thriving |
| **Soil Health** | Future growth depends on it | pH balanced, nutrient rich |
| **Water Retention** | Forests prevent erosion | 94% retention rate |
| **Wildlife Habitats** | Forests are ecosystems | 23 species documented |
| **Growth Rate** | Sustainable harvesting pace | Harvesting < 60% of growth |

## Section 3: Our Practices

### Title: "How We Maintain the Balance"

**Visual Treatment:** Side-scrolling cards on mobile, grid on desktop

#### Practice 1: Selective Harvesting
**Icon:** Single tree among many
**Visual:** Before/after showing minimal forest impact
"We remove individual trees, not entire areas. The forest canopy remains, protecting soil and smaller trees."

#### Practice 2: Seasonal Timing
**Icon:** Calendar with seasons
**Visual:** Winter harvesting scene
"We harvest in winter when sap is down and ground is frozen, minimizing damage to forest floors and root systems."

#### Practice 3: Natural Regeneration
**Icon:** Seeds dispersing
**Visual:** Young trees growing among mature ones
"We allow natural seeding alongside our planting, maintaining genetic diversity and forest resilience."

#### Practice 4: Zero Waste Workshop
**Icon:** Circular arrow
**Visual:** Sawdust becoming forest mulch
"Wood shavings become animal bedding, then compost. Offcuts become smaller products. Bark returns to forest floor."

#### Practice 5: Local Focus
**Icon:** Map pin in forest
**Visual:** Map showing forest to workshop distance
"Our forests are within 50km of our workshop. Shorter transport means lower emissions and deeper connection to the land."

#### Practice 6: Chemical-Free Processing
**Icon:** Leaf checkmark
**Visual:** Natural finishing process
"We use heat treatment for pest control, natural oils for finishing. Nothing that wouldn't decompose safely in soil."

## Section 4: The Forest Keepers

### Title: "Guardians Across Generations"

**Personal Stories Format:**

```
[Photo: Elderly man teaching child to identify trees]

"My grandfather taught me to read the forest
like a book. Now I'm teaching my granddaughter.
She knows that this tree she's planting today
might become something beautiful in her workshop
when she's my age."

- Karl, Forest Manager
  Third Generation
```

```
[Photo: Woman examining soil with scientific equipment]

"Science confirms what my family always knew—
healthy forests are complex ecosystems, not
tree farms. Every decision we make considers
the fungi, the insects, the birds, the whole web."

- Dr. Lisa Andersson
  Forest Ecologist, Second Generation
```

```
[Photo: Young person planting with elder supervising]

"I'm learning that sustainability isn't about
rules and certifications. It's about knowing
that my children will walk these same paths,
and their children after them."

- Erik Jr.
  Fourth Generation Apprentice Forester
```

**Forest Tours:**
- Spring: See new growth emerging
- Summer: Experience full canopy
- Autumn: Understand selection process
- Winter: Observe sustainable harvesting

---

## Section 7: The Deeper Connection

### Title: "Why This Matters"

**Philosophical Layer:**

**Visual:** Split screen - Chaotic industrial logging vs. peaceful selective harvesting

**Content:**
"There are two ways to view a forest. As a resource to be exploited, or as a partner in a generations-long dance. We choose partnership.

Every piece we craft carries the forest's story—the storms it weathered, the seasons it witnessed, the soil it grew from. When you choose our products, you're not just buying wood. You're participating in a cycle that began before us and will continue long after.

This is what peace and harmony with nature actually looks like. Not just taking less, but giving back more. Not just sustaining, but enriching. Not just for now, but for always."

## Content Examples

### Opening Statement

"In 1952, when our grandfather felled his first tree, he planted three. Not because anyone required it, but because he understood something fundamental: we are borrowing from our grandchildren. Today, four generations later, we're harvesting trees he planted and planting forests for grandchildren not yet born. This is sustainability as we practice it—not as corporate policy, but as family promise."

### Cycle Description

"Follow a single tree's journey: Selected in winter when the forest sleeps. Harvested with surgical precision, protecting its neighbors. Transformed in our workshop into something beautiful and lasting. Its bark and sawdust returning to nourish the forest floor. Three saplings taking its place, planted by hands that will tend them for years. This is the circle we complete with every product we create."

### Impact Statement

"When you choose a TWG table, you're not just furnishing a room. You're planting a small forest. You're storing carbon for decades. You're supporting biodiversity. You're ensuring that somewhere, right now, new trees are taking root because of your choice. This is partnership with nature, made tangible."
