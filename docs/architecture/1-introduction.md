# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **TWG Landing Page**, including frontend implementation, content management, and deployment infrastructure. It serves as the single source of truth for development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This is a greenfield project focused on creating an elegant, nature-inspired web presence for a woodworking and furniture manufacturer. The architecture emphasizes visual storytelling through performant glassmorphism effects and smooth interactions, while maintaining simplicity through static site generation.

## 1.2 Project Context

- **Timeline:** 2 weeks (80 man-hours per team member)
- **Team:** 5-6 developers, 3 QA testers, 1 PM, 1-2 UI/UX designers
- **Content Update Frequency:** Quarterly or annual (static content)
- **Target Audience:** B2B clients seeking woodworking partnerships
- **Deployment Strategy:** Daily preview deployments, production deployments as needed

## 1.3 Starter Template

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield Project

**Approach:** Starting with minimal Astro template, adding only necessary dependencies. This provides:
- Zero JavaScript overhead by default
- Full control over glassmorphism implementations
- Easy Sanity integration via build-time queries
- Optimal bundle size from the start
