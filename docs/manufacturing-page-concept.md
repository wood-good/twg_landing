## TWG - Craftsmanship Through Generations

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 7, 2025
**Narrative Focus:** Generational craftsmanship, not corporate manufacturing
**Emotional Goal:** Pride, authenticity, trust through heritage

## Core Narrative

### The Story We're Telling

**We are not a factory. We are a family of craftsmen.**

Three generations of woodworkers have passed down not just tools, but an intimate understanding of every grain pattern, every seasonal change in the wood, every subtle technique that transforms raw timber into lasting beauty. While corporations chase quarterly profits, we chase perfection in every piece.

Text overlay (right side, glass card):
"My grandfather taught me to listen to the wood.
Each tree grows differently - storms strengthen
the grain here, sunshine softens it there. We
don't force the wood into submission. We work
with its natural character."

- Magnus, Third Generation Craftsman
```

```

**Narrative Points for Each Era:**

**1950s - The Foundation**
"Armed with nothing but hand tools and an uncompromising standard, our founder began..."

**1980s - Evolution, Not Revolution**
"New techniques emerged, but the core remained: understanding wood as a living material..."

**2010s - Technology Serves Tradition**
"CNC precision guided by generational wisdom. We use computers, but they don't make decisions..."

**Today - Teaching Tomorrow**
"The fourth generation learns not from manuals, but from watching, feeling, understanding..."

### Section 3: Our Process - Where Tradition Meets Precision

**Title:** "How We Work"

**Visual Treatment:** Side-by-side comparisons

**Process Steps (with narrative focus):**

#### 1. Selection
**Corporate Way:** "Bulk purchasing by specifications"
**Our Way:** "Each board chosen by eye and touch"

**Visual:** Split screen - warehouse vs craftsman at lumber yard
**Micro-copy:** "We know our wood's origin story"

#### 2. Preparation
**Corporate Way:** "Automated scanning and sorting"
**Our Way:** "Hand inspection for character and potential"

**Visual:** Industrial scanner vs craftsman with light and loupe
**Micro-copy:** "Technology assists, but doesn't decide"

#### 3. Shaping
**Corporate Way:** "Mass production settings"
**Our Way:** "Adjustments for each piece's personality"

**Visual:** Production line vs craftsman at workbench
**Micro-copy:** "No two pieces are identical, nor should they be"

#### 4. Joining
**Corporate Way:** "Standard adhesives and fasteners"
**Our Way:** "Traditional joinery when it matters"

**Visual:** Glue gun vs dovetail joint being fitted
**Micro-copy:** "Some techniques haven't been improved upon"

#### 5. Finishing
**Corporate Way:** "Spray booth automation"
**Our Way:** "Hand-rubbed when the piece demands it"

**Visual:** Industrial spray booth vs hand finishing
**Micro-copy:** "You can feel the difference"

#### 6. Inspection
**Corporate Way:** "Quality control checklist"
**Our Way:** "Would I put this in my own home?"

**Visual:** Clipboard vs craftsman running hand along surface
**Micro-copy:** "Standards written in pride, not procedures"

**Title:** "Where Tradition Lives"

**Interactive Element:** 360° workshop tour (static fallback images)

**Hotspot Content:**

**The Workbench (100+ years old)**
"Four generations have worked at this bench. The worn spots tell stories of countless projects."

**Tool Wall**
"Some tools are centuries old, some arrived yesterday. We choose based on the task, not the age."

**The Apprentice Corner**
"Every master was once here, learning to see what machines cannot."

**Wood Library**
"Aging gracefully, waiting for the right project. Some pieces have been here for decades."

### Section 5: Our Craftsmen

**Title:** "The Hands Behind the Work"

**Profile Cards:** (Glass morphism design)

```
[Portrait Photo]
Magnus Eriksson
Third Generation Master
"42 years at the bench"

"I still learn something new
from wood every day. That's
why this never feels like work."

Specialization: Complex joinery
Teaching: 6 current apprentices
```

```
[Portrait Photo]
Erik Lindqvist
Finishing Specialist
"The difference is in the details"

"A proper finish doesn't just
protect wood - it reveals its
true character."

Specialization: Hand finishes
Heritage: Son of a boat builder
```

```
[Portrait Photo]
Anna Svensson
Precision Craftsperson
"Where tradition meets technology"

"I program our CNC, but I think
like a hand carver. The machine
follows my experience."

Specialization: Digital craftsmanship
Background: Trained in traditional marquetry
```

---

### Section 6: What This Means for You

**Title:** "Why Craftsmanship Matters"

**Value Propositions (framed personally):**

**Consistency Through Understanding**
"Machines produce uniformity. We produce consistency. There's a difference - one that comes from understanding how wood behaves across seasons, humidity, and time."

**Problems Solved Before They Exist**
"We see potential issues that scanners miss. A slight grain deviation that might cause warping in five years? We catch it now."

**Customization Without Compromise**
"Need something specific? We don't reprogram machines. We adapt our approach, applying decades of problem-solving experience."

**Direct Relationship**
"Call us and you'll speak to someone who's actually touched wood today, not a sales representative reading a script."

### Section 7: The Proof

**Title:** "Work That Stands the Test of Time"

**Case Studies Format:**

## Visual Design Direction

### Photography Style

**Key Principles:**
- **Intimate, not industrial** - Close-ups of hands, tools, details
- **Warm lighting** - Golden hour workshop light, not fluorescent
- **Process-focused** - Capture the act of making, not just results
- **Authentically imperfect** - Sawdust, wood shavings, worn tools

**Shot List Priorities:**
1. Hands working with wood (various ages of hands)
2. Eye-level detail inspection
3. Traditional tools in use
4. Apprentice and master together
5. Wood grain close-ups
6. Workshop atmosphere shots
7. Finished pieces in natural light

### Color Palette

```css
:root {
  --mfg-warmth: #D4A574;      /* Sawdust gold */
  --mfg-craft: #8B4513;       /* Tool leather */

  --mfg-fresh: #F5DEB3;       /* Fresh shaving */
  --mfg-deep: #2C1810;        /* Old wood depth */
}
```

### Typography Hierarchy

**Headlines:** Serif (Playfair Display) - Crafted, classical
**Body:** System fonts - Clean, readable
**Quotes:** Italic serif - Personal voice
**Captions:** Small sans-serif - Unobtrusive

## Content Examples

### Opening Paragraph

"In 1952, my grandfather established this workshop with a simple belief: wood deserves respect, and clients deserve craftsmanship. Three generations later, we still start each morning the same way—running our hands across the grain, listening to what the wood wants to become. While others have industrialized, we've refined. While others have automated, we've educated the next generation. This isn't stubbornness. It's the understanding that some things—the feel of perfectly joined wood, the satisfaction of a hand-rubbed finish, the pride in work that will outlast us all—cannot be programmed into a machine."

### Process Description Example

"When Magnus selects lumber, he's not checking boxes on a specification sheet. He's looking for what others might miss—a particularly tight grain that suggests strength, a subtle color variation that could become a piece's signature feature, the way light plays across the surface. This board might wait months for the right project. That's patience you won't find in a factory, but it's why our pieces don't just meet specifications—they exceed expectations."

### Craftsman Quote

"My hands are calibrated by forty years of experience. I can feel a thousandth of an inch variation that a digital gauge might miss. More importantly, I know whether that variation matters. That's the difference between measurement and understanding."
— Erik, Master Finisher
