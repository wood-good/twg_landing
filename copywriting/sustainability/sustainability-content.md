# SUSTAINABILITY

## Headline:
**A Circle Not a Line**

## Body Copy:
We don't extract. We participate.

Our cycle is complete: **sawing, crafting, replanting.** Every tree we use, we replace. Every piece we make, we ensure can return to the earth—or be passed to the next generation—without leaving damage behind.

Solid oak isn't just a choice for longevity. It's a choice for honesty. Wood composites and veneered boards have hidden costs: adhesives that off-gas, cores that crumble, surfaces that peel and deceive. Solid wood simply *is*. It ages with dignity. It repairs cleanly. It composts completely.

We believe the most sustainable furniture is the kind you never throw away.

Our workshop runs on the principle of **zero theatrical gestures.** No greenwashing. No carbon-offset theater. Just the quiet, ancient practice of taking only what you give back.

**The forest remembers. So do we.**
