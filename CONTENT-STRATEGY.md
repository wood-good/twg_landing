# TWG Landing - Content Strategy

**Philosophy**: We don't sell tables. We inspire people to live differently and see new perspectives in life.

---

## 🎯 Content Principles

### 1. **Emotional Over Transactional**
- ❌ "Buy our premium oak tables"
- ✅ "Create spaces where families gather, decisions are made, and memories take root"

### 2. **Philosophy Over Product**
- ❌ "200cm x 100cm solid oak dining table"
- ✅ "Three generations of listening to wood's journey from forest to forever"

### 3. **Storytelling Over Specifications**
- ❌ "European oak, hand-finished, available in 3 sizes"
- ✅ "Each piece carries memory—of seasons, storms, and silent growth"

### 4. **Timeless Over Trendy**
- ❌ "Modern minimalist design, perfect for 2024 interiors"
- ✅ "Crafted to outlive trends, carry stories, and become heirlooms"

### 5. **Intentional Over Excessive**
- ❌ Long paragraphs, many words, dense copy
- ✅ Short, impactful statements with generous whitespace

## 📝 Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice
**Contemplative • Authentic • Intentional • Timeless**

### Tone Guidelines

| Situation | Tone | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Homepage Hero | Awe-inspiring, poetic | "Where Forest Meets Forever" |
| Philosophy | Personal, authentic | "We listen to the grain, respect the growth rings" |
| Process | Transparent, educational | "Selection. Understanding. Crafting. Connecting." |
| Portfolio | Understated, confident | Brief captions, let images speak |
| Contact | Welcoming, human | "Start a conversation" not "Request a quote" |

### Writing Style

**DO:**
- Use active voice: "We craft" not "Tables are crafted"
- Short sentences: 15-20 words maximum
- Concrete imagery: "oak grain" not "quality materials"
- First person: "We" not "The company"
- Present tense: "We create" not "We have created"

**DON'T:**
- Corporate jargon: "solutions," "leverage," "synergy"
- Superlatives: "best," "world-class," "unparalleled"
- Sales language: "buy now," "limited time," "exclusive offer"
- Passive voice: "Tables are made" not "We make tables"
- Technical specs (unless contextual): "MC 8-10%" → "Carefully dried oak"

Headline: Three Generations of Listening

Lead: We don't sell tables. We connect the wood's strong energy to the home it belongs to.

Body:
Each piece of oak carries memory—of seasons, storms, and silent growth. Our craft is about honoring that journey, guiding each table to the space where it will finally rest.

Three generations of knowledge flow through our hands. We listen to the grain, respect the growth rings, and let the material guide our decisions. This isn't manufacturing—it's conversation between maker and material.

### Philosophy Page

```
Metadata: Philosophy — What Drives Us

Headline: Hands That Remember

Lead: We are not furniture makers. We are keepers of a conversation three generations old.

Section 1: Our Craft
Wood has memory. It remembers the forest. The storms it weathered. The seasons it counted. When we work with oak, we're not shaping material—we're honoring a journey that began decades before our hands touched it.

Section 2: Three Generations
My grandfather taught my father. My father taught me. Not techniques—though those matter. They taught listening. How to hear what wood wants to become. When to push. When to yield.

Section 3: Not Manufacturing
We don't have a catalog. We don't mass-produce. Each table begins as a conversation. What do you need? How do you gather? What memories will this hold?

Then we walk to the wood. We look. We listen. We choose the oak that wants to become your table.

Section 4: The Energy
Some call it grain. We call it the wood's strong energy. It guides our hands. Tells us where to cut, how to join, when to stop and look again.

You'll feel it when you touch the finished table. The forest is still there. Quiet. Patient. Eternal.

Quote:
"Every table is a portal. Place your hands on the surface and you're touching decades of growth, generations of knowledge, centuries of tradition."

CTA: "See Our Process →"
```

### Process Page

#### Section 1: Selection
```
Metadata: Process — Step 1 of 4

Headline: Selection

Lead: Every table begins with choosing the right oak.

Body:
We walk through forests, looking for trees that have grown slowly, weathered storms, and developed the character that only time creates.

Not every oak becomes a table. We're looking for specific qualities: tight grain, clear growth rings, the kind of strength that comes from patience.

When we find it, we know. The wood tells us.

Next: Understanding →
```

#### Section 2: Understanding
```
Metadata: Process — Step 2 of 4

Headline: Understanding

Lead: Before we cut, we listen.

Body:
What space will this table fill? How many people will gather around it? What decisions will be made here? What meals shared?

This isn't about dimensions. It's about understanding the life this table will live.

We sketch. We discuss. We imagine the table in your space. Only then do we return to the wood.

Next: Crafting →
```

#### Section 3: Crafting
```
Metadata: Process — Step 3 of 4

Headline: Crafting

Lead: Our hands remember what machines forget.

Body:
Joinery that doesn't need glue. Surfaces that improve with age. Edges that invite touch.

This is where three generations of knowledge become one table. My grandfather's patience. My father's precision. My understanding of what endures.

We don't rush. Each phase receives the time it demands. The wood tells us when it's ready to move forward, and we listen.

Next: Connecting →
```

#### Section 4: Connecting
```
Metadata: Process — Step 4 of 4

Headline: Connecting

Lead: The table finds its home. The journey completes.

Body:
When your table arrives, it's not delivery. It's reunion. The oak returns to shelter, this time as foundation for your family's gathering.

First meal. First argument. First decision. First celebration. The table holds it all.

Years from now, you'll run your hand across the surface and feel the grain. The forest is still there. Quiet. Patient. Eternal.

This is where forest meets forever.
